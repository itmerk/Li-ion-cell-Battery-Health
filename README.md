# Li-ion Cell Dashboard

This project is a FastAPI application that visualizes the State of Health (SoH) and various metrics for Li-ion cells. The data is fetched from a MySQL database and displayed using Plotly visualizations.

## Features
- **Overview Page:** Introduction and navigation links.
- **Cell Dashboard:** Dropdown to select and visualize the State of Health for specific cell IDs.
- **Detailed Data Visualization:** Subplot grids for selected cell data, including voltage, current, temperature gap, and capacity over time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- MySQL Server
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

bash
```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/li-ion-cell-dashboard.git```

```cd li-ion-cell-dashboard```


   
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

      ```python -m venv venv```
   
      ```source venv/bin/activate``` # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required Python packages:

   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

   You may need to create a requirements.txt file if it does not exist. Hereâ€™s an example of what it should include:

   ```fastapi```
   ```uvicorn```
   ```mysql-connector-python```
   ```pandas```
   ```plotly```
   ```jinja2```

4. Set Up MySQL Database:
   Ensure you have MySQL Server running and a database named li_ion_cells created. Update the get_db_connection function in the main.py file if your database credentials or configurations are different.
   
5. Run the FastAPI Application:

   Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

   ```uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8080 ```

   * main refers to the name of your Python file (without the .py extension).
   * app is the FastAPI instance within the file.
   * --reload enables auto-reloading during development.
   * --port 8080 sets the port to 8080.
  
6. Access the Dashboard:

   Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to view the dashboard.

Endpoints
Overview Page: /

Provides navigation links to various parts of the dashboard.
Cell Data Page: /cell

Fetches and processes cell data from the database.
Displays a pie chart of the State of Health and degradation for the specified cell ID.
